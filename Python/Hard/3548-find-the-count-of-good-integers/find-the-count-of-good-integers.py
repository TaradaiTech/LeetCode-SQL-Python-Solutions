        Count the number of good n-digit integers.
        A "good" integer is one whose digits can be rearranged to form a k-palindromic number,
        where a k-palindromic number is a palindrome that is divisible by k.
        
        For n = 1, we simply check the single digits 1-9.
        For n > 1, we generate all possible n-digit palindromes by constructing the half part
        and mirroring it (adding a middle digit if n is odd). Then we filter those palindromes
        by checking divisibility by k.
        
        Finally, for each distinct digit frequency pattern (after sorting digits), we count the
        number of unique permutations without leading zeros.
